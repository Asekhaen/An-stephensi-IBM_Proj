We develop a spatially-explicit individual-based model (IBM) in discrete space and time that simulates the population dynamics, life history, and genetics of a generic diploid insect (e.g. dipterans) across a network of metapopulations/patches connected by dispersal. The model incorporates key biological processes: mating/reproduction, growth/transition, survival, and dispersal. Simulations are undertaken on a daily time step (indexed by $t$). Within each patch (indexed by $j$), individuals (indexed by $i$) are explicitly represented and tracked according to their life stage (egg, larva, pupa, adult), sex (male or female, denoted $\male$, $\female$ respectively), viability status (alive or dead), and diploid genotype. Stochastic life-cycle processes are described below.

## Reproduction

Whether or not a female reproduces in a given time period ($R_{i \in \female), j, t}$) depends upon a chain of events.  Each adult female can potentially mate with any adult male present in the patch, and this occurs with some probability $m$ given at least one adult male is present in the patch.  Whether this mating then goes on to the successful production of eggs is also probabilistic, and depends on the female acquiring a bloodmeal, which we treat as occurring with probability, $b$.  Thus:

$$
R_{i \in \female,j,t} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(bm)
$$


For each reproducing female, the number of eggs/offspring produced per day is drawn from a Poisson distribution: 

$$
O_{i \in \female, j, t} \sim \text{Poisson}(f R_{i \in \female,j,t})
$$
where $f$ is the daily female fecundity.


## Stage Development

Each individual carries a variable denoting the individual's stage, $S_i \in \{egg, larva, pupa, adult\}$. Individuals transition between developmental stages according to stage-specific transition probabilities, $\vec{g}$, which records transition probabilities $\{g_{egg \rightarrow larva}, g_{larva \rightarrow pupa}, g_{pupa \rightarrow adult}, g_{adult \rightarrow adult}\}$ where $g_{adult \rightarrow adult} = 1$. Individual transition is stochastic, with realised transitions occurring as a draw from a Bernoulli distribution, according to:  

$$
D_{i,j,t} \sim\text{Bernoulli}(\vec{g}_{S_i})
$$

## Daily survival

Survival is governed by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic survival is the baseline survival influenced by the individual's internal mechanisms (e.g. biology and genetics). This determines the maximum survival rate for each stage, $\vec{v} = {v_{egg}, v_{larva}, v_{pupa}, v_{adult}}$

Conversely, extrinsic survival is influenced by external factors such as extreme temperature, predation, resource limitation and competition, etc. is captured through temperature-dependent and density-dependent survival probabilities.  

Temperature-dependent survival is a function of site and time:

$$
\phi_T (j,t)= e^{-\frac{(T_{j,t} - T_{\text{opt}})^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

where $T_{j,t}$, represents the daily recorded temperature at a given site, and $T_{\text{opt}}$ the optimum survival temperature, and $\sigma$, a factor that controls how steep survival respond to temperature changes outside optimum temperature condition. 

Similarly, density-dependent survival is a function of site and time: 

$$
  \phi_N(i,j,t) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } S_i \ne \text{larva}\\
      (1 - \frac{c_{j,t}}{C_j}) & \text{if } S_i = \text{larva}
    \end{cases}       
$$

where $c_{j,t}$ is the number of larva in each patch, and $C_j$, the larvae carrying capacity for each patch. This formulation assumes a linear decrease in survival as larval density approaches the carrying capacity. TO BE UPDATED TO CORRECT DD FUNCTION.

Finally, realised survival is treated as a stochastic process with a draw from a Bernoulli distribution:

$$
V_{i,j,t} \sim\text{Bernoulli} (\vec{v}_{S_i}\phi_T (j,t)\phi_N(i,j,t)).
$$


## Daily Dispersal 

Adults (male and female) disperse between patches according to an exponential dispersal kernel. Dispersal from origin ($j$) to destination ($k$), occurs with a probability that decreases exponentially as the Euclidean distance between patches increases. The dispersal kernel $K$ is given below as: 

$$
K_{j,k} = 
\begin{cases}
e^{-\lambda d_{j,k}}, & j \ne k \\
0, & j = k
\end{cases}
$$
where $d_{j,k}$ is the Euclidean distance between patches and $\lambda$ is an exponential decay parameter that controls the decay rate, and then each row of the resulting dispersal matrix is then normalised (sum to 1) resulting in conditional probabilities $M_{j,k}: 

$$
M_{j,k} = \frac{K_{j,k}} {\sum_{k} K_{j,k}}
$$
and since only a fraction $r$ of the adults disperse daily, the true probability $P_{j,k}$ of an individual moving from $j$ to $k$ is calculated thus:

$$
P_{j,k} =
\begin{cases}
\text{if } j = k,  & 1- (r.M_{ij} + (1-r).I) \\
\text{if } i \ne j, & r.M_{ij} + (1-r).I  
\end{cases}
$$
where $I$ is the diagonal of the dispersal kernel and is = 0

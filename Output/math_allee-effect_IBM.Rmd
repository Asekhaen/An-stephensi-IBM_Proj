We develop a spatially-explicit individual-based model (IBM) in discrete space and time that simulates the population dynamics, life history, and genetics of a generic diploid insect (e.g. dipterans) across a network of metapopulations/patches connected by dispersal. The model incorporates key biological processes: mating/reproduction, growth/transition, survival, and dispersal. Simulations are undertaken on a daily time step (indexed by $t$). Within each patch (indexed by $j$), individuals (indexed by $i$) are explicitly represented and tracked according to their life stage (egg, larva, pupa, adult), sex (male or female, denoted $\male$, $\female$ respectively), viability status (alive or dead), and diploid genotype. Stochastic life-cycle processes are described below.

## Reproduction

Whether or not a female reproduces in a given time period ($R_{i(\female), j, t}$) depends upon a chain of events.  Each adult female can potentially mate with any adult male present in the patch, and this occurs with some probability $m$ given at least one adult male is present in the patch.  Whether this mating then goes on to the successful production of eggs is also probabilistic, and depends on the female acquiring a bloodmeal, which we treat as occurring with probability, $b$.  Thus:

$$
R_{i \in \female,j,t} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(bm)
$$


For each reproducing female, the number of eggs/offspring produced per day is drawn from a Poisson distribution: 

$$
O_{i \in \female, j, t} \sim \text{Poisson}(f R_{i \in \female,j,t})
$$
where $f$ is the daily female fecundity.


## Stage Development

Each individual carries a variable denoting the individual's stage, $S_i \in \{egg, larva, pupa, adult\}$. Individuals transition between developmental stages according to stage-specific transition probabilities, $\vec{g}$, which records transition probabilities $\{g_{egg \rightarrow larva}, g_{larva \rightarrow pupa}, g_{pupa \rightarrow adult}, g_{adult \rightarrow adult}\}$ where $g_{adult \rightarrow adult} = 1$. Individual transition is stochastic, with realised transitions occurring as a draw from a Bernoulli distribution, according to:  

$$
D_{i,j,t} \sim\text{Bernoulli}(\vec{g}_{S_i})
$$

## Daily survival

Survival is governed by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic survival is the baseline survival influenced by the individual's internal mechanisms (e.g. biology and genetics). For each individual, the baseline survival according to it's stage $S_i \in \{egg, larva, pupa, adult\}$ as previously described is given by stage-specific survival probabilities $\vec{g} = {v_{egg}, v_{larva}, v_{pupa}, v_{adult}}$ and drawn from a Bernoulli distribution: 

$$
V_{i,j,t} \sim\text{Bernoulli}(\vec{g}_{S_i})
$$
conversely, extrinsic survival, influenced by external cues such as extreme temperature, predation, resource limitation and competition, etc., is captured through temperature-dependent and density-dependent survival probabilities.  

Temperature-dependent survival $V_{i,j,t} (T)$ is given below:


$$
V_{i,j,t} (T) \sim\text{Bernoulli}(\vec{g}_{S_i} T)

$$
where $T$ is the factor that controls the effect of daily temperature fluctuations on survival and is described below:

$$
T= e^{-\frac{(T_{\text{daily}} - T_{\text{opt}})^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$
such that $T_{\text{daily}}$, represents the daily recorded temperature variation, $T_{\text{opt}}$ the optimum survival temperature, and $\sigma$, a factor that controls how steep survival respond to temperature changes outside optimum temperature condition. Similarly, density-dependence survival $V_{i,j,t} (S_{\text{dd}})$ (exclusively for the $\{larva\}$ stage), is also drawn from a Bernoulli distribution and is shown below: 


$$
V_{i,j,t} (S_{\text{dd}}) \sim\text{Bernoulli} (V_{i,j,t} (T) S_{\text{dd}})
$$
$$
S_{\text{dd}} = \left(1 - \frac{C_l}{k} \right)
$$

where $S_{dd}$ is the density-dependent factor estimated by the number of larvae $C_l$ in each patch, and $k$, the larvae carrying capacity for each patch. This formulation assumes a linear decrease in survival as larval density approaches the carrying capacity. 


## Daily Dispersal 

Adults (male and female) disperse between patches according to an exponential dispersal kernel. Dispersal from origin ($i$) to destination ($j$), occurs with a probability that decreases exponentially as the Euclidean distance between patches increases. The dispersal kernel $K$ is given below as: 

$$
K_{ij} = e^{-\lambda d_{ij}}
$$
where $d_{ij}$ is the Euclidean distance between patches and $Î»$ is an exponential decay parameter that controls the decay rate. Each row is then normalised (sum to 1) resulting in conditional probabilities $M_{ij}$ of moving between patches $i$ to $j$. 

$$
M_{ij} = \frac{K_{ij}} {\sum_{j}^{i} K_{ij}}
$$
and since only a fraction $r$ of the adults disperse daily, the true probability $P_{ij}$ of an individual moving from $i$ to $j$ or remaining is calculated thus:

$$
P_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
\text{if } i = j,  & 1- (r.M_{ij} + (1-r).I) \\
\text{if } i \ne j, & r.M_{ij} + (1-r).I  
\end{cases}
$$
where $I$ is the diagonal of the dispersal kernel and is = 0
